Question 1:
A person’s telephone number 
    - string
A person’s height 
    - float
A person’s age 
    - int
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer) 
    - enum
A person’s salary
    - decimal
A book’s ISBN 
    - String
A book’s price
    - decimal
A book’s shipping weight
    - float
A country’s population
    - long
The number of stars in the universe
    - double
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the
United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)
    - int


Question 2:
Differences between values type and references type variables includes:
1.Value type will hold the value while reference type will hold the memory address or reference for this value. 
2. Value types are stored in stack memory while reference types are stored in heap memory. 
3. Value type will not be collected by the garbage collector but reference type will be collected by the garbage collector. 
4. The value type can be created by struct or enum while reference type will be created by class, interface, delegate or array. 
5. Value type can not accept null values whereas reference type can accept null values.

Boxing represents the conversion of the value type to the reference type/object type 
Unboxing represents the conversion of the reference type to the value type


Question 3:
They are related to memory management.
Managed resource is the resource handled by the .NET runtime and garbage collector.
Unmanaged resource is not directly handled by the .NET runtime, and it requires explicit cleanup using Dispose() method of IDisposable interface


Question 4:
The garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for an application.
This means that we don't have to write code to perform memory management tasks. 
Automatic memory management can eliminate common problems, such as forgetting to free an object and causing a memory leak or attempting to access memory for an object that's already been freed.
