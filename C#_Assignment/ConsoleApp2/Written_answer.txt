1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
    - We use String to handle small size and immutable text.
      We use StringBuilder when performing frequent or large string manipulations, since it's mutable.


2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    - The base class is System.Array.


3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    - We can use Array.sort() method from the System.Array class.


4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
    - Use the Length property to get the total number of elements.


5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    - No, we can only store the same type of elements in System.Array.


6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    - CopyTo() requires an existing array, while Clone() creates a new array.
      CopyTo() can copy into specific positions; Clone() always creates an identical array.
